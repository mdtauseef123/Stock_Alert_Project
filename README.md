# Stock_Alert_Project
In this project I have used https://www.twilio.com/ for sending the message via Twilio API, https://www.alphavantage.co/ for Stock Price and https://newsapi.org/ for News API.
Basically we are providing the stock alert message to the user by comapring the closing price of yesterday and day before yesterday price and along with sending the top three message related to the particular stock.
